# Preliminary Project

## TEUP to Survive

TEUP's mascot tries to stay alive, picking up instruments for the tuna and scaring off the security guards from FEUP's garden.

- Chosen Theme: #1 - FEUP\_Jet
  - Background: FEUP garden
  - Player: TEUP mascot (a tiger)
  - Jet power: Jetpack? Flying mat?
  - One key for firing roars of the tiger
  - Power-ups: beer (continuous fire), coffee (temporary shield), magnets
  - Obstacles: people, books, COVID masks, rocks
  - Collectibles: tambourines (pandeiretas), guitars, microphones
  - Enemy NPCs: building security (maybe shooting is not a very decent firing idea...)
